# FOR NEXT STABLE VERSION
=========================
=========================

# CODE ISSUES:
==============
* genind2df does not handle the pop argument correctly. -- fixed (TJ)
* check the behavior of the constructor when one of several loci are entirely non-typed (same for individuals/populations) -- done, was a pb in df2genind, now fixed (TJ)

# DOCUMENTATION ISSUES:
=======================
* 

# NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS:
=====================
* implement different levels of ploidy in genind / genpop objects.

# TESTING:
==========
* 



# LOW PRIORITY / MINOR BUGS
===========================
===========================
* in spca, when nfposi=0, the returned object actually contains what corresponds to nfposi=1. Comes from multispati in ade4. To correct.
* use spcaIllus to illustrate global.rtest and local.rtest
* check all examples and look for possible improvements
* Implement "sep" argument in df2genind
* Implement a method to merge different markers for the same individuals
* Build accessors for marker names, indiv names, pop names, spatial coords, ...
* Return a spatial object from monmonier (class sp?)
* Issue a warning when NAs exist in input of sPCA -- done (TJ)
* genind2df: add an option to give NA per allele instead of per locus: NA[sep]NA instead of NA.

# LONG TERM
==========================
==========================
* import from geneticsBase -- wait for geneSet to be stable
* export to geneticsBase -- same thing
* see where code needs tuning, and use C/C++
* implement global.rtest and local.rtest for genind/genpop objects
* Implement method "scale" for genind / genpop objects
* Implement dudi wrappers for genind / genpop objects
* Check the formulae provided for Reynolds (consistent with Felsenstein's
formulae, not straightforward reading the original article)
