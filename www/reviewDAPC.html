      <p class="opinion">Evaluation of the DAPC paper by Laurent
        Excoffier on
        the <a href="http://f1000.com/">Faculty of 1000</a>:<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic;" class="opinion">This paper
        elegantly
        combines a series of existing multivariate methods to detect the
        genetic structure of populations from genomic data. I found the
        validation of the methodology extremely convincing, as it shows
        that
        one can clearly recover very complex patterns and even
        hierarchical
        genetic structures.</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic;" class="mainFindingAndContext"> The
        authors propose the analysis of large genomic data sets by
        combining
        three model-free multivariate analysis techniques. The idea is
        to
        perform a discriminant analysis (DA) on genomic data, after the
        main
        axes of variation have been extracted by a principal component
        (PC)
        analysis, and genetic clusters of individuals have been
        identified by a
        sequential K-means and model selection method. The first use of
        a PC
        analysis solves two problems preventing the normal use of DA on
        genomic
        data. It reduces the number of genetic dimensions to a number
        smaller
        than that of the sampled individuals, and it ensures that
        information
        provided by each dimension is uncorrelated, thus removing
        potential
        effects of linkage disequilibrium. The Discriminant Analysis of
        Principal Components (DAPC) is blazingly fast and allows one to
        nicely
        visualize the respective positions of clusters and individuals
        in a
        reduced number of dimensions. In a few simulated cases, the
        resulting
        clustering of the populations matched exactly the underlying
        genetic
        structure, even in complex cases with isolation by distance, or
        when
        there was a hierarchical structure of the clusters, which is
        difficult
        to recover by other multivariate analyses (see e.g. {1}).
        <br>
        <br>
        Among a growing number of new multivariate techniques {1}, DAPC
        seems
        to be a very simple, robust, and useful tool for the finding and
        the
        visualization of clusters of individuals. When such clusters
        make
        little sense, like in admixture analysis for instance, a simple
        PC
        analysis may seem more appropriate {2}. While being a model-free
        approach, DAPC efficiency in recovering true genetic structure
        may be
        due to the fact that principal components are actually related
        to
        demographic parameters via coalescence times {3}, making the
        distinction between model-based and model-free approaches more
        subtle
        than previously anticipated. </p>
