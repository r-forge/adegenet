== USAGE ==
The function hackLib has to be loaded in R, either by copy-pasting the code of libHack.R into the R console, or by using the R command 'source' to load the file, e.g.:
source("libHack.R")

The hack is made active by typing:
hackLib()

By default, libraries will be installed in "C:/Users/Public/Rlibs" (windows systems). Other locations can be specified by the user, as an argument of the function. For instance, linux users might use:
hackLib("~/Rlibs")
to create a library in their home directory.

Once the hack is activated, install packages normally. For instance, to install a package 'foo', simply use:
install.packages("foo")
